# Introduction
This repository consists of a group coursework project from the NTU SC4002-Natural Language Processing course.
<br> A sentiment classification system is built to analyze and assign a sentiment label to each sentence.

# Dataset
The movie review dataset from the Python datasets library is used to train, validate, and evaluate the model.

# Overview:
- To perform sentiment classification tasks, the data has to be processed by first tokenizing the text.
- A model is trained with the help of word embeddings to improve its ability to handle natural language.
- Enhance the system further with the use of transformers 

## Methodology
- Evaluate existing pretrained word embeddings, such as Glove or word2vec.
- Train and evaluate various deep learning models such as RNN, biGRU, biLSTM, and CNN.
- Explore pretrained transformers

# Results:
- RNN test accuracy: 71.85%
- biLSTM test accuracy: 78.14%
- biGRU test accuracy: 79.08%
- CNN test accuracy: 78.71%
- RoBERTa test accuracy: 88.9%
